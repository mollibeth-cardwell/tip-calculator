## My process

### Built with

- HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Bootstrap Grid and Flexbox
- Javascript
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)



### What I learned

I used this challenge to practice implementing Javascript to create the functionality of the tip calculator, as well as continued practice of CSS to match the design files as closely as possible. I used Bootstrap grid and flexbox to make the site responsive to various viewports.


### Continued development

To improve this site and match the design specs more closely, I'd like to look into how to override different settings of various browsers. For example, when using Chrome and an input field is active, it shows a highlighted border. This is something I found challenging to fix and did not readily find a solution through searching the internet. I'd like to spend more time understanding browser settings so that a site appears uniform across any device or browser used.
